1. Kinematic plot of arbitrary arithmetic combination of parameters using arbituary set of Minitrees filtered against arbituary categories:
> python KinematicPlots.py input.txt param.txt -o=./result
where input.txt provides the path and names of the Minitrees to be included in the analysis 
all the machineries are contained in the param.txt file where you provide a set of intructions for plotting the Kinematic variables

How to construct a param.txt file:
The syntax '$include' will add a key to every instruction specifying the general settings
For example:
> $include SETTING = REWEIGHT  DATADRIVEN  STACK  NOMERGE  FULLNAME  ORDERED SUMMARY OBS
This line will create a key called "SETTING" and its values are the list containing "REWEIGHT  DATADRIVEN  STACK  NOMERGE  FULLNAME  ORDEREDSUMMARY OBS"
The function of the specific setting is as follows:
REWEIGHT: the distributions will be reweighted by the corresponding k-factor for the specific Minitrees
DATADRIVEN: data driven background will be included to the distribution will its shape following the shape of the overal reducible background for a specific category
STACK: stack the plot to give an overall event distribution
NOMERGE: separate the distribution by categories, i.e. the contribution from different categories are not merged
FULLNAME: include the name of the Minitrees and categories used in the distribution of the input parameter
ORDERED: the labels of the distributions are ordered according to their name
SUMMARY: include the summary of the statistics for each processes
OBS: include the observed data in the plot
